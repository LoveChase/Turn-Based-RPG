# TURN BASED RPG (AR-RPG)

## This is a BEGGING OF A TURN BASED AR-RPG

![RPG app](https://i.ibb.co/XDfTDCp/RPG-IMAGE.png "RPG App")

### This project was built using the following

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### The game works as follows

* Start by choosing your monster

* Search for an Enemy
* Select your Character to attack
* Then end your turn after attacking
* This Game is currently only a prototype and does not continue further than the players turn.

#### This PROJECT ALSO CONTAINS A DECK MANAGER BASED ON YUGIOH AND AR EXTENSION USING AR.JS

* Combining all of these elements is the end goal of the project, but as a result this has made the demo incomplete while the app is transitioning.
